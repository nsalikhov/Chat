# Chat
Simple chat with registration and communication via public and private messages.

Project is based on ASP.NET MVC5, WebSockets and KnockoutJs.

For simplicity:
 - there is no inputs validation except checking required fields;
 - return url is not implemented;
 - there is no helper messages, such as "Registration completed" and others;
 - only a few classes are covered by unit test;
 - users data stored in memory, another storage can be used by implementing IUserRepository interface;
 - ...and more others imperfections.
